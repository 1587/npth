             nPth - The New GNU Portable Threads Library
             ===========================================

This is a library to provide the GNU Pth API and thus a non-preemptive
threads implementation.

In contrast to GNU Pth is is based in the system's standard threads
implementation.  This allows the use of libraries which are not
compatible to GNU Pth.  Experience witrh the Windows Pth emulation
showed that this is a solid way to provide a co-routine based
framework.
